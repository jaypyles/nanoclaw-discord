# User-specific context (main channel)

All user specific skills are formatted as user-*.md

Copy this file to `USER.md` and edit. USER.md is ignored by git and is tacked onto the main channel context so the agent knows your preferences.

```markdown
# My context

- **Name:** Your name or how to address you
- **Timezone:** e.g. America/Los_Angeles
- **Preferences:** e.g. "Keep replies short unless I ask for detail", "Use metric units"
- **Recurring:** Anything you want the agent to remember for this channel
```
